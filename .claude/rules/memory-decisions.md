# Project Decisions

Architectural and technical decisions made during sessions — with date and rationale. Update this file whenever a non-trivial decision is made or confirmed.

<!-- Example entry format:
## 2026-04-06 — Use Trigger.dev for background jobs
- **Decision:** All async/scheduled work runs as Trigger.dev tasks, not cron scripts
- **Why:** Checkpointing, retry logic, and observability built-in; no infra to manage
- **Implication:** New background tasks must follow the orchestrator+processor pattern

## 2026-04-06 — Supabase as primary database
- **Decision:** Postgres via Supabase for all persistent storage
- **Why:** OAuth auth, RLS, and real-time subscriptions needed; team already has access
- **Implication:** All schema changes go through Supabase migrations, not raw SQL

## 2026-04-22 — Reference docs converted from PDF to Markdown
- **Decision:** All three PDFs in `.claude/docs/` converted to `.md`. `Claude_Code_Context_Management_Hacks.pdf` (23MB) required `pdftotext` (bundled with Git for Windows) since it exceeded Claude's 20MB read limit.
- **Why:** `.md` files are directly readable as session context; PDFs require external tooling and consume more context overhead.
- **Implication:** All `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` references updated. Original PDFs remain in place alongside the `.md` files.

## 2026-04-20 — Boilerplate sync scope is locked
- **Decision:** `SYNC_PATHS` is permanently locked to: `.claude/`, `workflows/`, `tools/`, `brand_assets/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.mcp.json`
- **Why:** Project-specific files (`README.md`, `LICENSE`, `.env.example`, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, `CODEOWNERS`, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`) must never be overwritten by upstream boilerplate syncs — they carry per-project customizations
- **Implication:** Never re-add the excluded files to `SYNC_PATHS` in any sync script, edge function, or workflow config
