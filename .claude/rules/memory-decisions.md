# Project Decisions

Architectural and technical decisions made during sessions — with date and rationale. Update this file whenever a non-trivial decision is made or confirmed.

<!-- Example entry format:
## 2026-04-06 — Use Trigger.dev for background jobs
- **Decision:** All async/scheduled work runs as Trigger.dev tasks, not cron scripts
- **Why:** Checkpointing, retry logic, and observability built-in; no infra to manage
- **Implication:** New background tasks must follow the orchestrator+processor pattern

## 2026-04-06 — Supabase as primary database
- **Decision:** Postgres via Supabase for all persistent storage
- **Why:** OAuth auth, RLS, and real-time subscriptions needed; team already has access
- **Implication:** All schema changes go through Supabase migrations, not raw SQL

## 2026-04-28 — design-md skill added from awesome-design-md collection
- **Decision:** Added `/design-md` as a project skill at `.claude/skills/design-md/SKILL.md`. Uses `npx getdesign@latest add <brand>` to fetch any of 73 brand DESIGN.md files on demand.
- **Why:** Fills a gap between `skillui` (scrapes live sites) and designing from scratch. Covers 73 known brands (Linear, Stripe, Vercel, Notion, Figma, Spotify, Tesla, Supabase, etc.) with pre-built design system docs that LLMs read natively. No API keys or scraping required.
- **Implication:** `frontend-instructions.md` updated to route brand-named requests to `/design-md` first, before `/skillui`. `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md` updated to document the skill. Decision guide in SKILL.md clarifies which tool to use when.

## 2026-04-28 — webgpu-threejs-tsl skill integrated; setup.sh copies full skill dirs
- **Decision:** Added `dgreenheck/webgpu-claude-skill` as a project skill at `.claude/skills/webgpu-threejs-tsl/`. setup.sh step 8 now uses `cp -r` to copy the entire skill directory instead of just `SKILL.md`.
- **Why:** The webgpu skill ships with 7 reference docs, 5 JS examples, and 2 templates that SKILL.md references by relative path. Copying only SKILL.md would leave broken relative-path references on fresh clones. The `cp -r` approach is backward-compatible — existing skills (site-teardown, skillui) have only SKILL.md and are unaffected.
- **Implication:** Any future skill with supporting files will be fully preserved by setup.sh without extra config. Skills can now ship with any directory structure.

## 2026-04-22 — Reference docs converted from PDF to Markdown
- **Decision:** All three PDFs in `.claude/docs/` converted to `.md`. `Claude_Code_Context_Management_Hacks.pdf` (23MB) required `pdftotext` (bundled with Git for Windows) since it exceeded Claude's 20MB read limit.
- **Why:** `.md` files are directly readable as session context; PDFs require external tooling and consume more context overhead.
- **Implication:** All `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` references updated. Original PDFs remain in place alongside the `.md` files.

## 2026-04-27 — Project skills use subdirectory + SKILL.md format
- **Decision:** Skills in `.claude/skills/` must follow `<skill-name>/SKILL.md` structure (not flat `.md` files). `setup.sh` step 8 copies them to `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` where Claude Code actually reads them.
- **Why:** Claude Code's skill discovery only scans `~/.claude/skills/` and requires the subdirectory + `SKILL.md` naming convention. Flat `.md` files at `.claude/skills/skill-name.md` are silently ignored — skills won't appear in the available list and `/skill-name` returns "Unknown command."
- **Implication:** Any new project skill must be created as `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, then re-run `bash .claude/scripts/setup.sh` (or restart Claude Code after manual copy) to activate.

## 2026-04-27 — impeccable added as frontend design plugin
- **Decision:** `impeccable@impeccable` (github.com/pbakaus/impeccable) added to `enabledPlugins` and `extraKnownMarketplaces` in `settings.json`. `setup.sh` step 7 auto-installs it.
- **Why:** Provides 23 structured commands (`/impeccable polish`, `/impeccable audit`, `/impeccable critique`, etc.) and 24-issue anti-pattern detection that explicitly targets LLM-generated UI mistakes. Complements `frontend-design` and `ui-ux-pro-max` with opinionated design laws.
- **Implication:** `frontend-instructions.md` updated to include impeccable in the "Always Do First" workflow for critique/polish/audit passes.

## 2026-04-27 — skillui CLI added for design system extraction
- **Decision:** `skillui` (npm install -g skillui, github.com/amaancoderx/npxskillui) added as a project skill and CLI tool. The `/skillui` skill is at `.claude/skills/skillui/SKILL.md`.
- **Why:** Pure-static design system extraction from live sites, repos, or local dirs — no AI or API keys required. Outputs `SKILL.md`, `DESIGN.md`, and token JSON files that Claude Code auto-loads, enabling "match this site's design" workflows before any frontend build.
- **Implication:** Use `skillui` before building any UI that should match an existing site's visual language. `frontend-instructions.md` updated to include it in the "Always Do First" section.

## 2026-04-20 — Boilerplate sync scope is locked
- **Decision:** `SYNC_PATHS` is permanently locked to: `.claude/`, `workflows/`, `tools/`, `brand_assets/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.mcp.json`
- **Why:** Project-specific files (`README.md`, `LICENSE`, `.env.example`, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, `CODEOWNERS`, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`) must never be overwritten by upstream boilerplate syncs — they carry per-project customizations
- **Implication:** Never re-add the excluded files to `SYNC_PATHS` in any sync script, edge function, or workflow config
